### 1. Playlist generation dataset

- `/playlists` endpoint should be a general playlist generation data (songs) setup,
   where you can select whole playlists, pick songs within playlists,
   switch tab to single saved songs / albums etc;
   you can start with just playlists, but the table rows should be collapsible
   and show (ideally paginated) songs to pick and include in the playlist generation dataset;
   advanced stuff like caching can be considered later;
   
### 2. Migration page - error handling and feedback / pagination

### 3. Tech - consider ScalaJS and maybe also replacing Play
